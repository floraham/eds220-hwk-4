## **Task 1: Whitney Map**

- Title: LULC tile location map relative to CA & Mt. Whitney
- Goal/purpose of the repository:
The goal of this task is to create a simple map showing the location of the LULC tile section we used in the previous discussion section relative to the state of California and Mount Whitney. 
- Data citation: 

_First dataset_
A small section of the GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011, from the US Geological Survey (USGS). This is a raster file with a 30 m x 30 m pixel resolution. Each cell in the raster has a number representing the type of land cover. The data was pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary Computer to show a small region around Mount Whitney in California. Further information about the dataset can be accessed via the the datasetâ€™s Digital Object Identifier (DOI) link: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Gap Analysis Project (GAP), 2016, GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems 2011: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/F7ZS2TM0.

_Second dataset_
A shapefile of CA Geographic Boundaries. 
This is a subset of the US Census Bureau's 2016 TIGER database, which only has the state boundary.

## **Task 2: Thomas Fire False Color Map:**
- Title: False Color Map
- Short explanation of the goal/purpose of the repository: Using Landsat & false color imagery we identify the burn scar of the Thomas fire within the fire perimeter. 

- Data citation: 

_First dataset_
A simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. 

The data was accessed and pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary Computer to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution ([Landsat Collection in MPC](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)). Data should be used for visualization purposes only. 


_Second dataset_
A shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017. 
The [complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-all-1/about).
